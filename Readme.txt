Introduction
This project is about implementing a Multiclass Text Classification model using Naive Bayes algorithm. The project uses the "20 Newsgroups" dataset which consists of approximately 20,000 newsgroup posts from 20 different topics. The model is trained on a subset of the dataset and tested on the remaining data.

Requirements
The project requires Python 3.6 or later and the following libraries:

1.NumPy
2.Pandas
3.NLTK
4.Scikit-learn
5.Matplotlib

How to Run

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.Open jupyter notebook and navigate to the cloned repository.
3.Run the .ipynb notebook.
4.The notebook will guide you through the process of training the model and evaluating its performance on the test data.
